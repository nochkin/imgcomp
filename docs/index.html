<h2>What is imgcomp for?</h2>
The program "imgcomp" is for capturing long term motion triggered time-lapse photographs
using a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> with 
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/">camera module</a>.
The intended use is unattended monitoring and surveillance.
<p>
Unlike the "motion" package, it is not intended to work like a CCTV camera. 
Imgcomp was inspired by "trail cameras" - the sort that
is left strapped to a tree in the woods to take picture of passing deer and other
wildlife, with the images retrieved at a later time.
I use such cameras but found that the passive infrared motion sensing
would often miss events, especially in winter.  Sometimes
they would even miss a tractor driving past the camera!
<P>
I wrote imgcomp to monitor comings and goings at my rural property when I am
not there.  Unlike trail cameras, it will not miss anything, so long as it's
daylight.  However, it cannot be run on battery, and unlike passive infrared,
it will not trigger in the dark.

<h2>What imgcomp does not do</h2>
<li>Not for battery powered application.  It uses too much power.
<li>Does not capture video
<li>Does not work with USB web cameras (frame rate too low, cameras too unreliable)
<li>Has no user interface to speak of
<li>Is not for people unfamiliar with using Linux from the command line.
<p>
<b>
If you aren't comfortable editing configuration files or running a makefile,
before asking me questions,
get very familiar with linux.  This might take you a few months of study.
There is plenty about learning linux on the internet, please don't ask me
for pointers.  Sorry, I do not have time to teach you</b>

<h2>How imgcomp works</h2>
Imgcomp runs the raspberry pi camera capture program "raspistill" to capture
still pictures every second, but can go up to 3 frames per second.  Images are
captured to a ram disk.  Imgcomp then reads the images, and if it detects
a change from one image to the next, copies the image
to a more permanent directory in flash, organized by time and date.  The file date of
the original image is used for the time stamp, so organizing is still correct even
if images are analyzed after the fact.
<p>
Imgcomp will occasionally restart rapsistill if the exposure has changed by too
much because raspistill will not make exposure adjustments during a sequence.
Raspistill sometimes stalls and stops taking pictures for unknown reasons.
When imgcomp stops seeing new images, it will  restart raspistill.
<p>
Imgcomp tries to differentiate between important and unimportant changes.  Changes
that are localized to part of the image are more important than changes that
happen to the whole image.  Slow changes (such as clouds moving in) tend to be ignored.

<h2>Compiling imgcomp</h2>

It is assumed that you have raspian already installed on your Raspberry Pi.
<p>
I do not have a binary distribution for imgcomp.  Before using imgcomp, you will have
to compile it.  The compiler is already included in the default installation of
raspian.  If you don't know what compiling a program is, then you will not
have much luck with other aspects of setting up imgcomp.
<p>
Imgcomp uses libjpeg.  Because I don't like external dependencies, I included
a stripped down version of libjpeg in the distribution.  This will automatically
compile when you compile imgcomp.  Compiling everything will take a minute or two.
<p>
You can compile imgcomp by going into the imgcomp directory and typing:<br>
<div class="c">make</div><br>
This will compile imgcomp and the required library.
<p>
I recommend setting up imgcomp to run as user "pi" in the directory /home/pi/imgcomp<br>
The program "raspistill" will run as user "pi", but for other accounts requires root
privileges or messing with group permissions.  So just use the user id 'pi' and
avoid the hassle.
<p>
A test version (no live capture) of imgcomp can also be compiled for Windows
using the Microsoft Visual C compiler.  If you set up the compiler to be on
your path, running "make.bat" from the windows command prompt will build the
windows build.

<h2>Imgcomp setup scripts (automatic setup)</h2>
Most of the steps of setting up imgcomp described below can be automated
by unpacking the archive in the /home/pi/imgcomp directory and running:<br>
<span class="c">/home/pi/setup-imgcomp</span>
<p>
This automates creating the ram disk and a few other tweaks to make it run better.
<p>
If you want imgcomp to automaticall run at startup, run the script:<br>
<span class="c">/home/pi/setup-imgcomp-autorun</span>
<p>
This sets imgcomp to run in console mode at startup  (Best not to boot your pi
into graphical user interface mode).  It also adds a cron job to delete the
oldest recorded directory in /home/pi/images if free flash space is getting low. 

<h2>Manual imgcomp setup</h2>
<h3>Enable camera module</h3>
Run raspi-config to enable the camera module<p>
You also need to make sure that your camera module is installed and functioning.
Take some pictures with raspistill to test.  Type:
<div class="c">raspistill -o foo.jpg"</div><br>
Then check that foo.jpg is an image of what the camera was pointed at.

<h3>Make a ram disk</h3>
Imgcomp uses raspistill to capture images to the file system.  To avoid wearing out
the flash card, it's best to capture to a ramdisk.  Make a 20 megabyte ramdisk
by adding the following line to the end of <span class="c">/etc/fstab</span> :
<div class="c">tmpfs   /ramdisk        tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,size=20M   0       0</div>
<p>
Note that /etc/fstab is only read at startup, so to make this ramdisk active,
you will have to reboot your raspberry pi or type "mount /ramdisk"

     how to make this work on Raspberry Pi 2 -->

<h3>Setting up Camera LED blinking</h2>
Imgcomp can optionally blink the camera module's LED when it detects motion.
If you wish to enable this, please follow the steps below.

Disable normal function of the camera LED, add the following line to the end of
the file at <span class="c">/boot/config.txt</span>:

<div class="c">disable_camera_led=1</div>

<a href="http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/05/how-to-disable-the-red-led-on-the-pi-camera-module/">
More on how to do this here</a>
<p>
Imgcomp runs a separate program with root privileges to blink the LED.
This program is compiled as "blink_camera_led" along with imgcomp.
You can test that this blinks the camera's LED by running blink_camera_led with
root privileges with this command (which will prompt you for your password)
<p>
<div class="c">sudo ./blink_camera_led</div>
<p>
blink_camera_led toggles the GPIO line that goes to the camera LED on the raspberry Pi model b+.
If you are using a model A, you will have to modify the file blink_camera_led.c to specify
the appropriate GPIO line, then recompile by typing "make".
<p>
Once you have made sure that blink_camera_led blinks the LED, you will have to change the owner
of the file to root and set the "setuid bit".  This will allow the program to run with administrator
privileges even when invoked by a regular user.
<p>
<div class="c">sudo chown root blink_camera_led</div>
<div class="c">sudo chmod +s blink_camera_led</div>
<p>
After this, type "ls -l".  The blink_camera_led file should show roughly like this<br>
<div class="c">-rwsr-sr-x 1 root pi   6702 Jun 11 16:13 blink_camera_led</div>
<br>
If your terminal program supports colour highlighting, this line will also be highlighted.
Its important that the file attributes "-rwsr-sr-x 1 root" should match what is shown here.
<p>
-->
<h3>Configure startup on boot</h3>
It's best if imgcomp will automatically start after a power failure.  The easiest way to do
this is to add a line to /etc/rc.local.  Add the following line near the end of rc.local,
just above the line that reads <span class="c">exit 0</span>
<p>
<div class="c">su - pi -c "/home/pi/imgcomp/imgcomp" &amp;</div>
<p>
This will cause imgcomp to run on startup.  The login prompt will also start, but will quickly
become hidden by all the output that imgcomp produces.  However, you will still be able to
log into the console by typing your username and password.  However, your have to do this
blindly because your typing will be obscured by all the imgcomp output.
After logging in, type "killall -9 imgcomp" to kill
the program.  You can restart it by typing "imcomp/imgcomp &amp;" from the home directory.
Started this way, it will keep running even after you log out.


<h3>Disable screen blanking</h3>
To disable screen blanking in console mode:<br>

In the file /etc/kbd/config change:<p>
<span class="c">BLANK_TIME=30</span> to <span class="c">BLANK_TIME=0</span><br>
Also change:<br>
<span class="c">POWERDOWN_TIME=30</span> to <span class="c">POWERDOWN_TIME=0</span>
<br>
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=18200">more on this here</a>

<h3>Disable on screen logo</h3>
I prefer to disable the raspberry pi logo at the top of the screen
to leave more room for text.  To disable the logo, add <span class="c">logo.nologo</span> to the end of the line
in the file <span class="c">/boot/cmdline.txt</span>.  The line should look like this:<p>
<small>dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait <b>logo.nologo</b></small>

<h2>How image detection works</h2>
Imgcomp compares successive images.  Before doing detection, the images are 
resized to 1/4 size.  (you can also specify 1/2 or 1/8 scaling, but I have only used
1/4 myself).  Scaling eliminates pixel noise and makes it less sensitive
to very subtle shifts in the image.
<p>
Next, average brightness is computed for both images and noamalization (scaling) values
computed for both.  After that, brightness and colour differences are computed for each pixel of the
image.  A histogram of change size is constructed in memory.
<p>
It is assumed a typical change only affects one third of the image, so a difference threshold
is computed from the histogram based on that.  Change magnitudes are computed
based on this threshold.
<p>
After that, the image differences are examined again to find a window of maximum change.
This window is computed from a difference map further reduced by 4x, and the window is
4 pixels in size, corresponding to an actual 64x64 pixel window in the source image.
This windowing technique biases detection to clustered changes, which makes it less sensitive
to distributed changes such as snowflakes, rainfall, or grasses waving in the wind.
<p>
Based on the maximum window found, a global "difference" value is calculated.  This threshold
is compared to the sensitivity setting.  If the change is above the specified sensitivity
threshold, the difference is considered significant and the image, as well as the one
preceding it are saved.
<p>
<h2>Spurious change ignore</h2>
Imgcomp occasionally false-triggers if an insect or a bird flies past the camera.
This typically shows up in just one image frame, whereas changes of interest are usually
across several frames.  Use the option "spurious=1" in the imgcomp.conf file
to ignore these spurious changes.
